## Abstract: 
Mammalian carnivores are declining worldwide from human activities; simple behavioral indicators may help identify population trends such that these declines can be identified and mitigated. Anthropogenic disturbance has increased dramatically in parts of the Masai Mara National Reserve, Kenya between 1988 and 2018, mainly due to massive incursions by livestock and herders into the Reserve. Hyena behavior also changed markedly during this period. Here we inquired whether specific hyena behaviors predicted subsequent changes in populations of hyenas themselves, or in densities of lions and other sympatric carnivores. Group sizes of hyenas found at kills correlated with clan size in the clan most disturbed by humans. Rates at which we observed interactions between hyenas and lions varied over time, suggesting reduced abundance of lions in heavily disturbed areas. Whereas lion abundance appeared to decrease in disturbed regions, hyena numbers increased. Hyena movement speeds correlated with densities of sympatric carnivores up to five months in the future. Finally, we used a novel hierarchical multi-species distance sampling model to estimate differences in densities of multiple carnivore species between disturbed and undisturbed areas. Our results suggest that tracking certain hyena behaviors might be useful to those charged with conserving Africaâ€™s carnivores.
